   For first year students we recommend going through the :doc:`Terminal <terminal>` and :doc:`IDLE <idle>` sections. 
   The :doc:`Visual Studio Code <vscode/index>` section is also very useful, but **Visual Studio Code will not be introduced until later** 
   in the semester. 

Here you will find the essential tools needed to get ready to code in Python. The following sections function as short introductions, helping you to understand the basics of these tools.

* The :doc:`Terminal <terminal>` is the most direct line of communication between you and your computer

* :doc:`IDLE <idle>` is recommended only for :course-base:`02002 <02002>` - Introduction to Python Programming

* :doc:`Visual Studio Code <vscode/index>` is a strong tool for writing and editing Python code

* :doc:`Packages and environments <packages-and-environments/index>` allow you to organize your python installation and packages
