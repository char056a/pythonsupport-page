   For first year students we recommend going through the:

   - :doc:`Terminal <terminal>`
   - :doc:`IDLE <idle>`

   The :doc:`Visual Studio code <vscode/index>` section 
   will be introduced *during* the semester, so this can wait until introduced in
   the courses.

Here you will find the essential tools needed to prepare to code in Python.
The following sections function as short introductions,
helping you understand the basics of these tools.

* The :doc:`Terminal <terminal>` is the most direct line of communication between you and your computer

* :doc:`IDLE <idle>` (only recommended for students taking :course-base:`02002`/:course-base:`02003`)

* :doc:`Visual Studio Code <vscode/index>` is a strong tool for writing and editing Python code

* :doc:`Packages and environments <packages-and-environments/index>` allow you
  to organize your Python installation and packages
