Verification
--------------------------------------

Verify that your installation is successfull by following these steps:

1. Search for :menuselection:`Terminal` using your
   Spotlight search (:kbd:`Command+Space`) and press :kbd:`Enter`.
   Verify that ``(base)`` is shown to the
   left of your username.
   Something like the image below:

   .. card::

      .. image:: /os/gifs/Unix/conda-check-base.gif
         :width: 100%
         :align: center

2. Type ``idle3`` in the Terminal, then press :kbd:`Enter`.
   This should open a new window in which you can run Python code.

3. Verify the :guilabel:`IDLE` window says ``Python {{ python_version }}.X``
   in the top left
   (or in the range of {{python_version_min}} -- {{python_version_max}}).

4. Copy the following Python code into the :guilabel:`IDLE` window, then press :kbd:`Enter`:

   .. code:: python

      import dtumathtools, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, uncertainties

   Verify that a new line (``>>>``) appears without any text (indicating everything got imported correctly).
   See the below image for an example:

   .. card::

      .. image:: /images/install/MacOS-IDLE-import.png
         :width: 100%
         :align: center

If some steps result in a different than described above, please continue reading the Troubleshooting section.


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only follow these troubleshooting steps if something in the previous section did not check out.


* Ensure that Miniconda is installed, follow
  :ref:`these instructions <install-python-macos-conda>`.

* Ensure the packages are installed (if they are already installed, this will not do anything).

  Paste the following line of code to the Terminal and press :kbd:`Enter`:

  .. code:: bash

     conda install python={{ python_version_recommended }} dtumathtools pandas scipy statsmodels uncertainties -y


* Go back to the previous Verification section and check them again.
