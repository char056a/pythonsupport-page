Install Python 
=================

In this section, you will find different installation guides that cover the 
same components

- Python,
- Python packages required for 1\ :sup:`st` year students,
- ``conda`` and
- Visual Studio Code.

Importantly, these installation guides are specifically designed for students who meet at least one of the following criteria:

- First-year Bachelor students at DTU
- Students taking one of:

  - Mathematics 1a/1b (:course-base:`01001`/:course-base:`01002`/:course-base:`01003`/:course-base:`01004`)
  - Computer Programming (:course-base:`02002`/:course-base:`02002`)
  - Physics (:course-base:`10060`/:course-base:`10063`/:course-base:`10065`)

These guides, although tailored for 1\ :sup:`st` year students, are also ideal for anyone needing to use Python.
