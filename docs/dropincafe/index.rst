Drop-in Caf√© Basic IT skills
==================================


* Are you struggling with using your computer?
* Are you in doubt of how to organize your files in your new role as a student?


DTU has initiated a new initiative that teaches students how to manage, use,
and navigate their computer file systems. We also strive to make basic terminologies
apparent and descriptive to enable you as a student.



When?
-------

The Drop-in Cafe will be open 

* in weeks 38 --- 49 (except 42).
* in building 306, 1st floor
* Tuesday and Thursdays between 17-19.



Activities
------------

* File System scavenger hunt

   
  .. card::

     A visual exploration of how files and folders are organized on
     a computer.

     After this activity the student will have experience in:

     - Understanding the file-explorer, navigating up/down in the file-tree

     - Understand what editing files *means* for a computer, i.e. that
       edits are not done implicitly on the file system

     - Know that renaming files is equivalent to moving files (and vice versa)

     - Understand where Downloaded files (from a browser) is placed in the
       file system.

* More are in the works...



Terminology
------------

This is a non-exhaustive list of terminologies used when interacting with a computer.
Some are language specific which means they may have different names on your computer
if you have a different language setting (e.g. :guilabel:`File Explorer` on Windows is named :guilabel:`Stifinder` in the Danish version). 


.. list-table:: Terminology
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Explanation

   * - File/folder tree
     - The hierarchical structure of directories and files on a computer.
   
   * - Filesystem
     - The actual representation of the file/folder tree on the computers harddrives (disks).

   * - .. _it-skills-tbl-file-explorer:

       File Explorer/Finder
     - The operating systems interactive view of the File/folder tree.
       This is the primary way for users of a computer to interact with their files
       and folders.

   * - Extension
     - Files can have *extensions* that is formatted by a ``.`` and the extension.
       E.g. ``.txt``. The extension informs the operating system how the file should
       be handled. For instance ``.docx`` files are Word documents, ``.py`` files
       are Python scripts.

   * - Path
     - The full file-tree name of a file or folder in the file/folder tree.
       E.g. ``C:\Users\MyName\my_document.docx``.

   * - Compressed files
     - Files can be reduced in size by re-arranging the internals of the file.
       This makes them un-readable until one decompresses the files.

       Some files are more succeptible for large compressions (text files), while
       other files will rarely be compressed further (JPEG images).

   * - Command
     - An instruction given to a computer program on the command line interface (terminal)

   * - Directory separator
     - On {{ windows }} the directory separator is ``\``, while for {{ macos }}, the separator
       is ``/``.

   * - .. _it-skills-tbl-hard-disk:

       Hard disk/drive
     - The hardware that hosts everything on the computer. The operating system, files
       required for the computer to work, as well as files that the user creates, images,
       text documents, etc.

   * - Memory
     - A dedicated place of space meant for the operating system to hold temporary disk space.
       This is very fast for the computer to work with. As opposed to the :ref:`Hard disk <it-skills-tbl-hard-disk>` which is rather slow.

   * - Cloud/Remote storage
     - A :ref:`hard disk <it-skills-tbl-hard-disk>` that is not physically on your computer.
       It is located somewhere else in the world, and requires internet access to interact
       with files on said storage.

   * - Terminal
     - A program that allows one to execute commands by *writing what to do*.
       See :ref:`this table for commands <it-skills-tbl-term>`.

   * - PowerShell ({{windows}})
     - The recommended terminal program in Windows.

   * - Command prompt ({{windows}})
     - A non-recommended terminal program in Windows.

       Windows has both PowerShell and Command prompt. We highly encourage
       users to stick with PowerShell.


.. _it-skills-tbl-term:

.. list-table:: Terminal
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Command
     - What it does?
   * - ``cd <dir>``
     - Changes the current directory to ``<dir>``.
       Equivalent to double-clicking the folder ``<dir>`` in your :ref:`File Explorer/Finder <it-skills-tbl-file-explorer>`.
   * - ``ls``
     - List the files and directories in the the current directory.
       Equivalent to viewing files and folders in the :ref:`File Explorer/Finder <it-skills-tbl-file-explorer>`.

   * - ``mv <from> <to>``
     - Will move file/folder ``<from>`` to ``<to>``.

       Notice that ``mv file1 file2``
       will simply rename the file from ``file1`` to ``file2``.
   
   * - ``rm <?>``
     - Deletes files/folders named ``<?>``.

   * - ``python3``
     - Used to run Python programs from the terminal. Either scripts or interactively.


.. _it-skills-tbl-mac:

.. list-table:: {{macos}} specific terms
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Explanation

   * - :guilabel:`Applications` folder
     - The directory on {{macos}} where installed applications are stored.
       Deleting applications here will un-install them.

   * - :guilabel:`Dock`
     - The Dock is a place to fast access certain applications and features.
       It can be re-arranged to any of the screen edges. By default
       it is located at the bottom of the screen.
   
   * - :guilabel:`Finder`
     - The :ref:`File Explorer <it-skills-tbl-file-explorer>` for {{macos}}.

   * - ``/``
     - The directory separator for {{macos}}.


.. _it-skills-tbl-windows:

.. list-table:: {{windows}} specific terms
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Explanation

   * - :guilabel:`Add/Remove Programs`
     - Allows uninstalling Programs. Generally applications are installed through
       dedicated files, so this feature is typically only used for un-installing software.

   * - :guilabel:`File Explorer`
     - The :ref:`File Explorer <it-skills-tbl-file-explorer>` for {{windows}}.

   * - ``\``
     - The directory separator for {{windows}}.
