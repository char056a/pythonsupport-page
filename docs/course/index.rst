   Courses may have their guides on how to install. We encourage
   students to refer to these resources primarily.
   The documentation here is considered complementary to the course
   material, unless otherwise stated by the teacher.

.. tip::

   If an error occurs during the installation process, it is *vital*
   to report it to :mail:`pythonsupport@dtu.dk` so we can correct it or
   add content for workarounds.

   Thanks!
