Uninstall software
------------------

In some cases it is necessary to completely remove a Python installation
or an editor.

If you experience hard-to-resolve problems, it might be because you have
installed all packages in your global Python home (i.e. using ``pip``
in your base installation, *not* in a virtual environment).
If this is the case, you are recommended to delete your installation,
and when using a new one, please do remember to use :doc:`virtual environments </learn-more/packages-and-environments/index>`.
